# Text-Query-Program
simple text-query program. Our program will let a user search a given file for words that might occur in it. The result of a query will be the number of times the word occurs and a list of lines on which that word appears. If a word occurs more than once on the same line, we’ll display that line only once. Lines will be displayed in ascending order—that is, line 7 should be displayed before line 9, and so on.

### simple start:
run

```
./a.out phone.txt
```

when phone.txt is example txt source.

run the following queries:

‫‪* word‬‬
‫‪* NOT‬‬ ‫‪word
* word1‬‬ ‫‪AND‬‬ ‫‪word2‬‬ ‫‪
* word1‬‬ ‫‪OR‬‬ ‫‪word2‬‬ ‫‪
* word1‬‬ ‫‪n‬‬ ‫‪word2‬‬ ‫

 
else will show:

```
‫‪Unrecognized‬‬ ‫‪search‬‬
```
