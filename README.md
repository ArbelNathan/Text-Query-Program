# Text-Query-Program
simple text-query program. Our program will let a user search a given file for words that might occur in it. The result of a query will be the number of times the word occurs and a list of lines on which that word appears. If a word occurs more than once on the same line, we’ll display that line only once. Lines will be displayed in ascending order—that is, line 7 should be displayed before line 9, and so on.
